					<h2> WHAT IS HPC</h2>
				</div>
				<p>High Perfomance Computing club (HPC) is one of the many clubs offered at the Queensland Academy for Science, Maths and Technology (QASMT). 
				This club is for students who are interested in computers and computer coding. In this club, we embark on many different project to either 
				help educate others about technology or help create an impact on the community. Currently we have 3 ongoing projects, The Weather Project (Year 10), 
				Scracth Workshop (Year 11) and a Supercomputing Project for the Year 12.</p>

					<h2> WEATHER PROJECT</h2>
				</div>
				<p> The Weather Project aims to provide data on the Weather at QASMT. Currently we are observing the weather of our recently built, open planned building (J Block) in our school.

					<h2> MEMBERS </h2>
				</div>
				<p> There are 14 members who are currently working on the Weather Projects. Through this project, we have connected through our love for computers and our similar sense of humour,
				especially our love for memes (hence the name memebers). Within the 14 of us, there are 4 different teams of people focusing on different areas of the project, these teams are the Software,
				Hardware, Database and Visualisation. Below are the Memelicious and Memerable Memebers profiles, they have either choosen a picture of themselves or a picture that represents them the most. </p>
