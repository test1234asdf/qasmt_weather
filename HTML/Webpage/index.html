							<h2> What is HPC? </h2>
						
							<p>
								High Perfomance Computing club (HPC) is one of the many clubs offered at the Queensland Academy for 
								Science, Maths and Technology (QASMT).  This club is for students who are interested in computers and 
								computer coding. In this club, we embark on many different project to either help educate others about 
								technology or help create an impact on the community. Currently we have 3 ongoing projects, The Weather 
								Project (Year 10), Scratch Workshop (Year 11) and a Supercomputing Project for the Year 12.

							<h2> Weather @ QASMT Project </h2>
							
							<p>
								The Weather @QASMT Project aims to provide data on the Weather at QASMT. Currently we are observing the weather of our recently built, open planned
								building (J Block) in our school.

							<h2> MEMEbers </h2>
							
							<p>
								There are 14 memebers who are currently working on the Weather Projects. Through this project, we have 
								connected through our love for computers and similar sense of humour, especially our love for memes 
								(hence the name, MEMEbers). Within the 14 of us, there are 4 different teams of people focusing on 
								different areas of the project. These teams are Software, Hardware, Database and Visualisation.
